# cpu_code_hopper
Forces python to run code on different cpus for efficiency
# How to run?
Just test the code in code.py

# Why make this?
I am testing an idea given by a friend about having different lines of code run on different CPUs. So far, I've gotten the affinity done, the code reader done too. Now I need to have python (or c++) read a test file line by line and execute each line separately.
